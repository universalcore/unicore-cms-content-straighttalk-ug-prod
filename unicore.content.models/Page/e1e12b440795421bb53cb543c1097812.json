  "content": "Faith begun her menstruation while at school. It was very embarrassing for her. She narrates, \"It happened in class with all my classmates around. I stood up to go to the toilet. My friend, pulled me down and said I should sit down quickly.\" \r\n\r\n\"Your uniform has a red patch,\" my friend whisphered. \r\n\r\n\"When I realised that I had stained my yellow uniform, I wanted the ground to swallow me there and then. Oh, it was such a terrible experience. I was so embarrassed. My friends helped me, but I spent the whole week at home. I could not bring myself to come to school and face my classmates. I thought the whole school knew. It took a while but I know now, that it is normal. I learnt how to count my days and keep track on the calendar so that it does not happen again. I always pack a pad and extra party, just in case  but I am now always ready. Fellow girls, be prepared, always! \r\n\r\n",
