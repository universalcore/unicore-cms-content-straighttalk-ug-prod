  "content": "Susan, 19 decided to get tested for HIV and tells what happened: I found out that my boyfriend had had sex with another girl while we were together. I had chucked him, but was left worried that I might be infected with HIV. We had been having unprotected sex. We had known each other for a long time, and we trusted each other so we hadn\u2019t used condoms. \r\n\r\nThat was a big mistake, I know now. I was so worried. I decided to take an HIV test. After counseling, I was called to get my results. I was sweating, and my heart was beating very first. I wanted to run out of there, but I needed to know the results. \u201cYour result is negative. You do not have HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,\" the counselor told me. \r\n\r\nI closed my eyes and gave a prayer of thanks. I promised myself that I would not have sex again without insisting on condoms.\r\n\r\n",
