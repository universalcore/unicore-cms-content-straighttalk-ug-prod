Breasts come in all shapes and sizes. There is nothing you can do about what your breasts look like. \r\n\r\nJust remember: All breast sizes \u2013 big or small \u2013 are good for feeding babies. Also know that one breast is usually bigger than the other breast. Growing breasts is a sign of growing up. Don\u2019t feel embarrassed. Whether your breasts are large or small, they are the right size for you.\r\n\r\n",
