Breasts come in all shapes and sizes. There is nothing you can do about what your breasts look like. Just remember: All breast sizes \u2013 big or small \u2013 are good for feeding babies. Also know that one breast is usually bigger than the other breast. Growing breasts is a sign of growing up. Don\u2019t feel embarrassed. Whether your breasts are large or small, they are the right size for you.\r\n\r\n[Let\u2019s Talk][1] \r\n\r\n[Take Action!][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/a2de9fe83e714755a6ffe2a0a5953353/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/9152ad836eec41959de1ffc5cf914d47/",
