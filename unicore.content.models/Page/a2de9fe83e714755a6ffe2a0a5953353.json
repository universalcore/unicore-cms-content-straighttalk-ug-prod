  "content": "\u201cI developed breasts recently, but I\u2019m worried at the rate they are enlarging. I don\u2019t mind having breasts, but I hope they do not grow extraordinarily big. At first I was wondering why they had delayed to come, but now I\u2019m scared about the size.\u201d\t\t\t\r\n\r\n**Fact:**\r\n\r\n Some girls begin to develop breast at age 8 or 9. Others start much later. Some girls\u2019 breasts grow slowly. For others the growth is very quick. Breasts come in all shapes and sizes. There is nothing you can do about what your breasts look like. Just remember: All breast sizes \u2013 big or small \u2013 are good for feeding babies. Also know that one breast is usually bigger than the other breast. Growing breasts is a sign of growing up. Don\u2019t feel embarrassed. Whether your breasts are large or small, they are the right size for you.\r\n\r\n**Act Now:**\r\n\r\nTalk to your parents or guardians. Or your senior woman teacher if you have any challenges. You can also visit your nearest youth centre and ask for the counselor for advice. For more information SMS to 6300.",
