This can happen: \r\n\r\n 1. Through unprotected sex with a person who has HIV.  \r\n 2. If a mother has HIV, her baby can get HIV during pregnancy, child birth or breastfeeding. \r\n 3. Through sharing sharp objects like razor blades, needles and injections.\r\n\r\n[Let's Talk][1]\r\n\r\n[Take Action!][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/cb1caa3ef3cb4e6ab21edbe657e9fb76/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/a91c6a98bf374f93bcd531374a91443e/",
