  "content": "Menstruation happens when a girl\u2019s body releases blood from her uterus through the vagina. The blood flows slowly for about 4-7 days in a month. Girls usually begin menstruating between the age of nine and 16. Everyone has their own time of starting because our bodies are different. Some girls may start menstruating when they are only 8 years while others may start when they are 16 years. However, if you are 17 and above and you have not yet started menstruating, see a doctor. Once a girl starts getting her periods, it comes once a month. But some girls may miss their periods for one or two months. This is alright. The hormones in the body are not balanced yet. If you are not having sex, don\u2019t worry about missed period. For girls who are having sex, a missed period may be a sign of pregnancy. Girls and boys, say NO to sex until you are over 18 years, after your studies and you can look after a family. Menstruation is one of the body changes girls get during puberty. \r\n\r\n[Let\u2019s Talk][1]\r\n\r\n[Take Action!][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/e1e12b440795421bb53cb543c1097812/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/4af288399ca543dd937107bdc232a1ff/",
