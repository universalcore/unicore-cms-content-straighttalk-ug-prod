  "content": "One of my close friends told me that I would lose my girlfriend if I didn\u2019t satisfy her sexually. Surely this made me very anxious so I started to experiment with her, even though she was not in the mood. This made me even more worried. \r\n\r\nThen I asked why she\u2019s not in the mood. She explained that making love could cause unwanted pregnancy and if this happens, we would lose our dignity in the community. Besides, we were not ready for a family and the responsibilities that come with children. \r\n\r\nAt the end we realised that as lovers, mutual respect and understanding is needed. We do not need to do things because of the pressure from friends and those around us. It is good to know what one wants. \r\n\r\n",
