Surely this made me very anxious so I started to experiment with her, even though she was not in the mood. This made me even more worried. Then I asked why she\u2019s not in the mood. She explained that making love could cause unwanted pregnancy and if this happens, we would lose our dignity from the community. At the end we realised that lovers need to have mutual respect and understanding and they need to ignore the pressure from other youth.\r\n\r\nSexuality Facts\r\n\r\nTake Action!",
