Avoid eating too much salt because salt causes your body to retain extra water especially around the time of your periods. \r\nDrink plenty of water.                                                                                                                          \r\n\r\nWhat to use: With or without money, you can deal with your periods just fine. You can use clean cotton clothes, toilet tissue, pads, or tampons. However, you need to change these frequently to avoid staining and bad smells.
