Exercise, exercise, exercise                                                                                                                        \r\n\r\nWhat to use: With or without money, you can deal with your periods just fine. You can use clean cotton clothes, toilet tissue, pads, or tampons. However, you need to change these frequently to avoid staining and bad smells. \r\n\r\nFor more information, SMS to 6300 or visit a Straight Talk Youth Centre in your area.\r\n\r\n",
